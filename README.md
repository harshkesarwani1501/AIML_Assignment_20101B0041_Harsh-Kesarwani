# Symptom-based-Disease-Prediction

'Symptom-Based Disease Prediction' aims to leverage machine learning algorithms for predicting diseases based on input symptoms. The project utilizes a pre-trained model to capture the relationship between symptoms and diseases. 
Algorithms used - Random Forest, Na√Øve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine
User Interface - Streamlit
Code - Jupyter Notebook/ Python IDE(Version 3.7.0)
Streamlit - Version 0.87.0(Install if not present)

Execution process - 
1) Download zip file and extract it
2) Open the folder with the files in command prompt
3) Type command 'streamlit run diseaseprediction.py'
